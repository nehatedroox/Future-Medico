                    <p>The college not only believes in educating children through books and becoming well educated;  but cares that they also become wise and responsible as future doctors. The college believes that each child is unique in his or her way and is, therefore, a progressive thinker. Teachers at TSPM do not teach the students instead they do self-study with them and this is how the bond between the two gets stronger and deeper. All the faculty members at the college are well experienced and educated who not only teaches students what is written inside the books but tells them what life is and what are their duties towards society. Adding to this the teachers also motivates students to take part in various recreational activities organised by the college like national and international seminars since it will ultimately help in the overall development of the child. As of now, the institute’s faculty along with the talented young minds of the country is working upon making their website that will profit the scholars, patients and research abroad. </p>
