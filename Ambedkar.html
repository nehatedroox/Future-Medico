                        <p>Because this is a medical institution, there is no formal mechanism for students to be placed, and the college does not have placement cells like other colleges. After completing their MBBS degree, students can work as general practitioners if they are registered with the state government. Students can work as junior doctors at medical schools and then as medical consultants, doctors in various hospitals, and private clinics following graduation. They can also work as independent practitioners.
                        <br>Students pursuing BPT and Allied Health Science degrees, on the other hand, will find work in hospitals, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, private clinics, and as freelancers. Spas, gyms, and health facilities run by major hotel chains are springing up all over the country, providing plenty of career prospects for physiotherapists. Professionals in this sector might make anywhere from 4 lakhs to 12 lakhs per year, depending on the region and company. Nurses, physiotherapists, and medical equipment handlers are estimated to earn roughly 6 lakhs per year on average.
                        The students also get the option of being employed as house staff under respective departments of the college. The students also get one and half years of internship after completing four years of study where they get a stipend of Rs 40,000 on average</p>
