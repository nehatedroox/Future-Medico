                    <p>Since this is a medical college there is no provision for placing the students in the formal sense and the college does not have placement cell-like colleges of other disciplines. The students after completion of their MBBS degree can practice as general practitioners provided they are registered under a State government. The students can work as junior doctors in medical colleges and after passing out they can work as medical consultants, doctors with various hospitals, and private clinics. They can also work as private practitioners as well.
                        The student’s diploma courses will have employment opportunities in Hospitals, Nursing Homes, Rehabilitation Centers, private clinics, as well as freelancing. There are various spas, gymnasiums, health centers coming up in big cities and towns run by prominent hotel chains which provide ample job opportunities for professionals trained in physiotherapy. In this field, professionals can earn anywhere between 4lakhs to 12 lakhs per year depending upon the location and organization. The average nurse, physiotherapist, or medical equipment handler is expected to earn around 6lakhs per annum. After sufficient years of experience, the yearly earnings of an individual can go as high as 12-14 lakhs per year.</p>
