                        <p>Prasanna College of Ayurveda and hospital was established in January 2013 under the supervision of Prasanna education trust, Belthangady, D.K Karnataka. The college is affiliated with Rajiv Gandhi institute of health and science, Bangalore, and is approved by the central council of Indian medicine.<br><br>

                        The college was established since the ex-minister of govt of Karnataka wanted to provide better and effective healthcare facilities to the people who live in the nearby surrounding. The trust also provides education to students in different disciplines of Ayurveda <br>
                        To keep the system of traditional Indian medicine alive.<br><br>

                        A variety of facilities are also available for people like the traditional practice of panchakarma(cleansing of the body through 5 actions) and yoga therapy and anyone can book their appointment online. Several experienced teaching faculty are the specialty of the college. Adding to this, well-trained paramedical staff are 24 hours on duty at the college hospital for taking care of the patients. Though it has been only 8 years since the college was established, it has achieved a stone mile in almost every aspect. As of now the college takes admission for 100 students per batch and provides them with an exceptional learning environment.<br>
                        Adding to this, the college is well equipped with spacious classrooms, a direction hall, a physiology lab, a central library, and all those facilities that a student requires. So now, let me take you on an amazing journey to Prasanna college of Ayurveda and hospital where we will get to know more about the college.</p>

                  <h3>HIGHLIGHTS</h3>      
                  <p>This is exactly what the college believes in and this is why it promotes Ayurveda. Since Ayurveda has been long lost for the past few generations, the college is working towards educating our present generation about the importance of the same. Teachers at the college are well experienced with a teaching experience of more than 10 years in their discipline who not only teaches the students about the theoretical concept of the subjects but also about the practical knowledge which is very important for them as future physicians of Ayurveda. The college hospital provides the facilities like panchakarma, Abhyangam( full body massage), Kaya Seka( relieves body pain), Shirodhara(effective remedy for mental disorders), and Uttara Basti (gynecological ailments) to ordinary citizens as well and charges some minimal fee for the same. The experience of these facilities is so soothing since Ayurveda focuses on your spiritual mind and body which provides mental peace and relaxation.</p>
