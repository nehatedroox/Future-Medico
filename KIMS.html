After the completion of part 1 and before entering part 2 of the same year they are allotted a time of 2 months for elective postings. The student will rotate through two elective blocks each consisting of 4 weeks duration. This will provide flexible choices in student’s areas of interest, direct individual experience and also help students to develop self-directed learning skills.</p>
